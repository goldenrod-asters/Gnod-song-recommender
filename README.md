# Gnod and asters
## Overview
"Gnod and asters" is a music recommendation project aimed at enhancing the current music recommender product offered by Gnod. The project involves researching and implementing new features to recommend individual songs, in addition to bands, based on collaborative filtering algorithms. The primary objective is to provide users with diverse and accurate music recommendations, incorporating global music trends and acoustic similarities.

## Project Details
This project involves collecting extensive data on popular songs from various sources and creating clusters of similar songs based on their acoustic characteristics. The resulting song recommender system will prioritize recommending songs from the same cluster when a user inputs a particular song.

## Features
Researching and incorporating data sources from popular songs
Initial exploration of song data using APIs or web scraping
Creating clusters of songs based on acoustic similarities
Prioritizing recommendations of songs from the same cluster
## Project Goal
The ultimate goal of the project is to develop an advanced and accurate song recommender system that complements Gnod's existing music recommendation capabilities. The successful implementation of new features will contribute to enhancing user experience and expanding partnership opportunities with music apps.

## Task Assignment
Jane, the CTO of Gnod, has assigned the task of exploring new data sources for songs and creating clusters of similar songs within the first week. The project follows an agile approach, providing flexibility to define products and features while exploring available tools and data.

## Presentation
At the end of the week, a comprehensive presentation of the work will be conducted, providing insights into the methodology, data collection, and clustering techniques utilized. The presentation will be shared with Jane and Marek, the CEO and founder of Gnod.
